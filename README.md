## Assumptions made while developing code
- Setting arrangements is fetched from server
- Any new feature developed mush a new feature module. This helps isn separation of concern, increase build time and dynamic feature delivery


## Explanation of module structure
- DI (ContextModule, DispatcherProvider, GlideModule, GsonModule, OkHttpClientModule, RetrofitModule)
- Extensions
- Utils



## Further improvements planned 
- [Interface] - Add Interface for all the layers, so that communication between layers happens via Interface and not concrete class.
- [Test case] - Add test case for ViewModel & Usecase
